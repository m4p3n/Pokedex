Pokedex is an app that shows a list of pokemon and permit you to choose one to see it's profile. 
Yeah, of course, it is not a REAL app, it has been made just for fun, I was really bored and wanna try the MVI pattern, so feel free to check my code and give me a feedback if you want. 

The app has been made with : 

*kotlin language
*custom MVI Pattern
*Koin dependency injection
*Retrofit
*Kotlin coroutines


Enjoy!
